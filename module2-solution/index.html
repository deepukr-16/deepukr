                <p>
                   Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman ([1] 7 November 1888 â€“ 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist who made groundbreaking works in the field of light scattering.[2] With his student K. S. Krishnan, he discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, 
                  some of the deflected light change wavelength and amplitude. This phenomenon was a new type of scattering of light and was subsequently known as the Raman effect (Raman scattering).[3][4] Raman won the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics and was the first Asian person to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.[5]
